# Bio-Inspired Onset Detection
### Optimization of Aubio-onset through an Evolutionary Computation algorithm

This repository contains the optimization and analysis of the performances of the Onset Detection tool AUBIOONSET from the Aubio Library in the context of real-time applications.
The performances are relative to a specific set of recordings that can be found at `/src/audiofiles/`
A Bio Inspired Evolutionary Computation algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of all the methods from aubioonset.

The code is contained in the `src` folder.
A report with results and considerations can be found in the `report` folder.
